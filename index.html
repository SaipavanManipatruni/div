          <h1>The Prophecy Begins</h1>
          <p>
            In the ancient city of Ayodhya, where the air was infused with
            spirituality and the rivers echoed tales of divine deeds, King
            Dasharatha and Queen Kaushalya ruled with benevolence. Their hearts
            ached for an heir to the throne. One day, the sage Vasishtha arrived
            at the royal court and prophesied that the king's prayers would be
            answered. Kaushalya would give birth to four sons, and the eldest,
            Ram, would be the embodiment of virtue and righteousness. As the
            years passed, the kingdom of Ayodhya flourished, and the bond
            between the brothers—Ram, Bharat, Lakshman, and Shatrughna—deepened.
            Ram, with his unwavering commitment to dharma, became the pride of
            Ayodhya.

          <p>
            Word of Sita, the beautiful princess of Mithila, spread far and
            wide. Her father, King Janaka, announced a grand swayamvara, a
            ceremony where suitors could compete for Sita's hand. Ram,
            accompanied by his brothers, accepted the challenge. In a test of
            strength, Ram effortlessly strung the divine bow of Lord Shiva,
            winning Sita's hand in marriage. Yet, the joyous occasion was marred
            by the scheming of Kaikeyi, Dasharatha's second queen. Manipulated
            by her maid Manthara, Kaikeyi demanded that Ram be sent into exile
            for fourteen years. Despite Dasharatha's anguish, Ram accepted the
            decree with unwavering obedience. Sita and Lakshman, devoted to Ram,
            chose to accompany him into the forest.

          <h1>The Forest Exile and Sita's Abduction</h1>
          <p>
            The forest exile unfolded as a journey of self-discovery, where the
            trio encountered sages, demons, and divine beings. In one fateful
            encounter, Surpanakha, a demoness smitten by Ram, approached him.
            When her advances were spurned, she sought revenge, leading to a
            chain of events that culminated in the abduction of Sita by the
            demon king, Ravana. Ram, driven by love and duty, allied with the
            vanara (monkey) warrior Hanuman and an army of loyal beings to
            rescue Sita from Lanka. The story unfolds in a crescendo of bravery,
            divine interventions, and moral dilemmas. As the chapter concludes,
            Ram stands at the threshold of war, ready to confront Ravana and
            rescue Sita, illustrating the eternal battle between good and evil.
